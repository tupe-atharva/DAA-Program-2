CS575 – Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
Programming Assignment 2 – Strassen's Matrix Multiplication and Large Integer Multiplication.  
Author: Atharva Tupe    

FILES :-
tupe_a_pa2_strassens.cpp
tupe_a_pa2_lim.cpp     
README.txt            

COMPILATION :-
Compile the program using the following command:
--> g++ tupe_a_pa2_strassens.cpp -o tupe_a_pa2_strassens
--> g++ tupe_a_pa2_lim.cpp -o tupe_a_pa2_lim

EXECUTION :-
Run the program with a single integer argument `n`,  
-> For Strassens Matrix Multiplication : ./tupe_a_pa2_strassens <n>
-> For large integer multipplication : ./tupe_a_pa2_lim <n> (where n is the number of digits and must be divisible by both 2 and 3)
